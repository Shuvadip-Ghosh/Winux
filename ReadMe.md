# WinuxShell

**WinuxShell** is a project that brings popular Linux commands to the Windows environment, enabling users to interact with their system in a Linux-like manner. The commands implemented in this project aim to replicate the behavior of Linux tools such as `cat`, `ls`, `touch`, `wget`, and more, making Windows more developer-friendly!

## Features

- **`cat`**: View the contents of a file, just like on Linux.
- **`ls`**: List files and directories in the current directory.
- **`touch`**: Create an empty file or update the timestamp of an existing file.
- **`wget`**: Download files from a URL, just like the Linux `wget` command.
- **`jav`**: A simplified way to run Java files using `jav <filename-with-extension>`.
- **`github`**: Easily commit and push code to GitHub. Usage: `github "<commit-message>" <remote-url-name> <branch-name>`.
- **`custom`**: Customize commands and activate a virtual environment by specifying `custom <name-of-environment>`.
